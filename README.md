🚧 Project Development Roadmap
This project is developed in four structured phases to ensure modularity, clarity, and scalability.

🔹 Phase 1: Video Event Detection System
⏱ Estimated Time: 4–5 days
🛠 Tools: OpenCV, YOLOv8 (or MobileNet SSD), Python

✅ Features:
🎥 Video input from webcam or file

🧍 Person detection & tracking (YOLO + DeepSORT)

🕒 Timestamped logging of events:

Entry/Exit

Motion

Object left behind

🖼 Save key frame snapshots for detected events

🗂 Store event logs in JSON / SQLite / PostgreSQL

🔹 Phase 2: Metadata Indexing & Storage
⏱ Estimated Time: 2–3 days
🛠 Tools: LangChain, FAISS / ChromaDB, Pinecone (optional), SQLite / PostgreSQL

✅ Features:
🔍 Extract semantic metadata from logs (e.g., “Person entered Zone A at 4:05 PM”)

✂️ Chunk and embed event logs using LLM embeddings

📦 Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Chroma)

🧠 Optional: Add image-caption pairs for enhanced semantic context

🔹 Phase 3: Natural Language Query Interface
⏱ Estimated Time: 3–4 days
🛠 Tools: LangChain, OpenAI API or LLaMA2, Streamlit / FastAPI

✅ Features:
💬 Users can ask natural language questions, such as:

“Show me all unusual activity between 12–2 PM”

“Was anyone near the restricted area today?”

🧠 LangChain parses the question → RAG searches the vector DB

📄 Returns relevant log snippets + snapshots with timestamps

🔹 Phase 4: Optional Advanced Features
⏱ Estimated Time: 5–7 days (optional)
🛠 Tools: OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Email APIs, Audio libraries

✅ Optional Features:
📍 Zone-wise activity detection using polygon masks

🚨 Alert system (email/SMS notifications on suspicious activity)

🔊 Audio cue analysis (detects loud noises, gunshots, alarms)

📈 Anomaly detection via unsupervised learning (autoencoders, clustering)

📊 Dashboard with:

Real-time camera feed

Historical log search

Event statistics and summaries
