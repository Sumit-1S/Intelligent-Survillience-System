🔹 Phase 1: Video Event Detection System
Time: 4–5 days
Tools: OpenCV, YOLOv8 (or MobileNet SSD), Python

Features:
 Video input (webcam or file)

 Person detection + tracking (YOLO + DeepSORT)

 Timestamped logging (enter/exit, motion, object left behind)

 Save key frame snapshots for detected events

 Store logs (JSON/SQLite/PostgreSQL)

🔹 Phase 2: Metadata Indexing & Storage
Time: 2–3 days
Tools: LangChain, FAISS/ChromaDB, Pinecone (optional), SQLite/PostgreSQL

Features:
 Extract semantic info from logs (e.g., "Person entered Zone A at 4:05 PM")

 Chunk and embed event logs

 Store embeddings in vector DB (e.g., FAISS)

 Optional: add image-caption pairs to enhance semantics

🔹 Phase 3: Natural Language Query Interface
Time: 3–4 days
Tools: LangChain, OpenAI or LLama2 API, Streamlit/FastAPI

Features:
 User can type questions like:

“Show me all unusual activity between 12–2 PM”

“Was anyone near the restricted area today?”

 LangChain parses question → searches vector DB (RAG)

 Returns relevant log snippets and snapshots

🔹 Phase 4: Optional Advanced Features
Time: 5–7 days (depending on features)

Features:
 Zone-wise activity detection (define zones using polygon masks)

 Alert system (email/SMS on suspicious activity)

 Audio cue analysis (detects loud sounds, gunshots, etc.)

 Anomaly detection (use unsupervised learning or autoencoders)

 Dashboard (real-time view, historical event search, stats)
